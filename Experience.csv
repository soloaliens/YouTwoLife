"I feel very good here! - ""Yes, and I also feel very good here!"" - You'll hear this from people who are well-suited to each other."
"I feel very good here! - ""No, I feel very bad here!"" - And that's typically what you'll hear from people who are not suited to each other at all. It's clear then why they stop living together."
Which option is yours? Do you have years for experimentation? We think every person should ask themselves this question.
"In nearly 20 years of our practice, we have built a knowledge base about the energies of thousands of people and conclusions about their compatibility or incompatibility depending on their energies."
"From these books, we have taken teachings on the interaction of a person's energy, their dwelling, and the energies of their spouse and children, and then created a system for calculating energies, which our programmers have turned into a clear and structured compatibility system for you."
"How these energies complement and interweave with the energies of the well-known Zodiac energies, related to astrology and numerology, you can find out from the books listed below. And you can get a quick result of compatibility of your energy and your chosen one with the help of very complex, but very fast calculations of our servers."
